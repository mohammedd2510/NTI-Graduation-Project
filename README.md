- Configured using Helm.
- Integrated Nginx Ingress Controller for efficient access management.
- Applied Kubernetes Network Policies for enhanced application security.

## üìã Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- **Terraform**: v1.5+
- **Ansible**: v2.12+
- **kubectl**: v1.25+
- **Helm**: v3.9+
- **AWS CLI**: v2+
- **Git**

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone -b IAC https://github.com/mohammedd2510/NTI-Graduation-Project.git
   cd NTI-Graduation-Project
2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**  
   Configure AWS CLI with your AWS account credentials:  
   ```bash
   aws configure   

3. **Provision Infrastructure with Terraform**  
Navigate to the `Terraform` directory, replace the backend S3 bucket name in `Provider_init.tf` with your own, initialize Terraform, and apply the configuration:
    ```bash
    cd ./IAC/Terraform
    # Replace the backend S3 bucket in Provider_init.tf
    terraform init
    terraform apply

4. **Configure Infrastructure with Ansible**  
   Use Ansible to automate the configuration of various components in your infrastructure. This includes:  

   - **CloudWatch Agent Installation**: Deploy CloudWatch agents to all EC2 instances for centralized log management.  
   - **Jenkins Server Installation**: Set up Jenkins on its dedicated EC2 instance, create the Jenkins admin account, install required plugins, and configure Jenkins credentials.  
     - Update the `vars/main.yml` file in the `Jenkins_Server_Installation` role with your Jenkins credentials, as the Jenkins credential configuration has been automated using Ansible.  
   - **Docker Installation**: Install Docker on the Jenkins EC2 instance to enable containerized builds.  
   - **ArgoCD Installation and Deployment**: Set up ArgoCD and execute the deployment script from the local machine.  

   After updating the necessary variables in the Ansible roles, execute the playbook:  

   ```bash
   # Update vars/main.yml in the Jenkins_Server_Installation role with your Jenkins credentials
   cd ./IAC/Ansible
   ansible-playbook roles_playbook.yml

5. **Set Up Jenkins Server**  
   After the Jenkins server is installed and configured using Ansible, perform the following steps manually to finalize the setup:  

   - **Access Jenkins**: Open the Jenkins server in your web browser. Use the public IP of the Jenkins EC2 instance:  
     ```
     http://<Jenkins-EC2-Public-IP>:8080
     ```  

   - **Configure Slack Plugin**:  
     - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**, and ensure the Slack Notification Plugin is installed.  
     - Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System** and add your Slack workspace details to enable notifications.  

   - **Configure Git Plugin**:  
     - Ensure the Git Plugin is installed from **Manage Plugins**.  
     - Set up global Git configuration under **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.  

   - **Create a Multibranch Pipeline**:  
     - Navigate to **New Item** > **Multibranch Pipeline** and provide a name for your pipeline.  
     - In the **Branch Sources** section, add your GitHub repository.  
     - Use credentials to authenticate with GitHub.  
     - Configure the repository URL and set up branch discovery to include all branches or specific branches as needed.  

   - **Enable Multibranch Pipeline Webhook**:  
     - In GitHub, go to your repository settings > **Webhooks**.  
     - Add a new webhook pointing to your Jenkins server webhook URL:  
       ```
       http://<Jenkins-EC2-Public-IP>:8080/github-webhook/
       ```  
     - Choose `application/json` as the content type and select the appropriate events for triggering the webhook.  

   After completing these steps, Jenkins will be ready to build and deploy your multibranch pipeline automatically.

## üìä Project Summary

This project demonstrates a robust **CI/CD pipeline** for a 3-tier web application, fully automated using best practices in **infrastructure as code (IAC)**, **continuous integration (CI)**, and **continuous deployment (CD)**. Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience with key DevOps tools such as **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Jenkins**, **Docker**, **ArgoCD**, and **Slack**, enabling me to streamline application deployment, infrastructure management, and monitoring. The solution integrates multiple tools to ensure smooth development workflows, from infrastructure provisioning to automated deployment, all while maintaining security and scalability.
